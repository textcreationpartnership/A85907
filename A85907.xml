            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Generall Reſolutions of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England and Scotland, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning His Maieſty, and the Parliament, and concerning the Kings Reſolution for the taking Arms.</head>
            <p>AT this preſent it is not unknown to the King who hath incenſed Him againſt His <hi>Parliament,</hi> and who have given Counſell derogatory to the Honour, and deſtructive to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> this is utterly unknown; Yet the King deſires evidence of theſe things from the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Nay, though hee diſavow the ſheltring of ill Miniſters, yet he conceals ſuch as have traduced, and ſlandered the Parliament in ſome things notoriouſſy falſe; and yet to an ordinary underſtanding, it is the ſame thing to conceal, as to ſhelter a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: and if it be below a King to
<pb facs="tcp:156787:3"/> reveal a trayterous Incendiary, that hath abuſed His ear with pernitious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it is below him too to leave him to Juſtice being otherwayes revealed.</p>
            <p>Here it is ſuppoſed that <hi>Parliaments</hi> may make an Ordinance contrary to Law, Nature, Reaſon, Sence; and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred therfore, That they are dangerous and may bring the life and libertie of the ſubject to a Lawleſſe, and arbitrarie ſubjection; this ſuppoſition is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with one of the moſt ſacred and venerable pillars of all Law and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and yet here it is inſiſted upon, let all Chronicles be ſearched, and let one Story be cited of any Parliament, which did tyrannize over King and Subject, or ordain any thing to the miſchief of both; Yet Kings I think will not make the ſame challenge. the beſt of them have done Acts of Oppreſſion, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are apparant for it; but no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can bee given why Parliaments ſhould uſurpe, or how they can uſurpe; yet the Kings inference runs againſt all
<pb facs="tcp:156787:3"/> Parliaments: He doth not ſay this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament tyrannizeth, and therfore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides from them, and pronounces their Votes invalid, but becauſe Parliaments may tyrannize; therfore they have no power in their Votes at all, at any time whatſoever, further then the King rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ſayes not ſo much; they ſay hee is now ſeduced by wicked Counſell, and therfore rejects their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, to the danger of the State.</p>
            <p>In ſuch Caſes they conceive there is a power in them to ſecure the State with out his concurrence: At other times when the Kings are not ſeduced, they ought to do nothing without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Our Caſe is not as <hi>Scotlands</hi> were, for our malignant party is far greater then theirs; yet both <hi>England and Scotland</hi> are reſolved to aſſiſt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament againſt all ſuch oppoſers, and will to the uttermoſt of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours root out all ſuch.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156787:4"/>
            <p> The queſtion concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> is not to be put indifinitely, whether or no the King ought to order the <hi>Militia</hi> in times of no extraordinary danger; our caſe is now upon ſuppoſition, if the King in extraordinary danger will not yeeld to ſuch a Poſture as the Kingdom thinks moſt ſafe, whether the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may not order that Poſture of themſelves, ſo the <hi>Parliament</hi> puts it. But the King puts it thus. If the Parliament invades his power over the <hi>Militia</hi> cauſeleſly, whether they may not as wel ſeize a any ſubjects Eſtates.</p>
            <p>That queſtion then which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all, is this, whether that Poſture which the <hi>Parliament</hi> chuſes, or that of the Kings, be moſt ſafe for the Kingdom at this time, and who ſhall judge moſt properly. Till now that the ancient pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Law, and policy were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the ſtate ſet upon a new baſis, no evill was to be preſumed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the Kingdome, nor no Juſtice expected from a King deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:156787:4"/> his grand Councell, but now every man may arraign <hi>Parliaments,</hi> no King was ever yet ſo juſt but that <hi>Parliaments</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve in ſome things reduced them from Errour, nor no Kings ſo unjuſt that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments did ſeduce into Errour, yet Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are now charged of being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Religion, Lawes, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And the King to preſerve theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf from Parliaments, but ſince we muſt diſpute for Parliaments; firſt wee ſay they muſt in probability bee more knowing then any other priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; Secondly, in regard of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like intereſt, they are more reſponſible then any other, and leſſe to be complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of in caſe of Errour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they have no private intereſt to deprave them, nothing can ſquare with the Common Councell but the common good, and if 500 of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry ſhould aym at an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticall Uſurpation, or any other power of oppreſſion, they could never compaſſe their ends, it were folly in them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156787:5"/>
            <p> The Lords all ſubſigned a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, to obey no Ordinance of <hi>Parliament</hi> that was contrary to the known Laws, and in particular that of the <hi>Militia,</hi> till the Royall aſſent were given to it, and to ſtand for, and defend the Kings perſon, &amp;c. And His Majeſty ſigned another to the Peers, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them according to the Laws, and to protect them, in whatſoever they ſhould lawfully do for their defence.</p>
            <p>It was reſolved upon the queſtion by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, <hi>That the Commiſſion of Array for Leyceſter is againſt Law, and againſt the Liberty and property of the Subiect.</hi> June 20.
