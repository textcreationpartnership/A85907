            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Generall Re≈øolutions of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England and Scotland, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning His Maie≈øty, and the Parliament, and concerning the Kings Re≈øolution for the taking Arms.</head>
            <p>AT this pre≈øent it is not unknown to the King who hath incen≈øed Him again≈øt His <hi>Parliament,</hi> and who have given Coun≈øell derogatory to the Honour, and de≈øtructive to the e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of all <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> this is utterly unknown; Yet the King de≈øires evidence of the≈øe things from the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Nay, though hee di≈øavow the ≈øheltring of ill Mini≈øters, yet he conceals ≈øuch as have traduced, and ≈ølandered the Parliament in ≈øome things notoriou≈ø≈øy fal≈øe; and yet to an ordinary under≈øtanding, it is the ≈øame thing to conceal, as to ≈øhelter a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: and if it be below a King to
<pb facs="tcp:156787:3"/> reveal a trayterous Incendiary, that hath abu≈øed His ear with pernitious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it is below him too to leave him to Ju≈øtice being otherwayes revealed.</p>
            <p>Here it is ≈øuppo≈øed that <hi>Parliaments</hi> may make an Ordinance contrary to Law, Nature, Rea≈øon, Sence; and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred therfore, That they are dangerous and may bring the life and libertie of the ≈øubject to a Lawle≈ø≈øe, and arbitrarie ≈øubjection; this ≈øuppo≈øition is incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtent with one of the mo≈øt ≈øacred and venerable pillars of all Law and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and yet here it is in≈øi≈øted upon, let all Chronicles be ≈øearched, and let one Story be cited of any Parliament, which did tyrannize over King and Subject, or ordain any thing to the mi≈øchief of both; Yet Kings I think will not make the ≈øame challenge. the be≈øt of them have done Acts of Oppre≈ø≈øion, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons are apparant for it; but no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons can bee given why Parliaments ≈øhould u≈øurpe, or how they can u≈øurpe; yet the Kings inference runs again≈øt all
<pb facs="tcp:156787:3"/> Parliaments: He doth not ≈øay this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament tyrannizeth, and therfore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides from them, and pronounces their Votes invalid, but becau≈øe Parliaments may tyrannize; therfore they have no power in their Votes at all, at any time what≈øoever, further then the King rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ≈øayes not ≈øo much; they ≈øay hee is now ≈øeduced by wicked Coun≈øell, and therfore rejects their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øts, to the danger of the State.</p>
            <p>In ≈øuch Ca≈øes they conceive there is a power in them to ≈øecure the State with out his concurrence: At other times when the Kings are not ≈øeduced, they ought to do nothing without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent.</p>
            <p>Our Ca≈øe is not as <hi>Scotlands</hi> were, for our malignant party is far greater then theirs; yet both <hi>England and Scotland</hi> are re≈øolved to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament again≈øt all ≈øuch oppo≈øers, and will to the uttermo≈øt of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours root out all ≈øuch.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156787:4"/>
            <p> The que≈øtion concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> is not to be put indifinitely, whether or no the King ought to order the <hi>Militia</hi> in times of no extraordinary danger; our ca≈øe is now upon ≈øuppo≈øition, if the King in extraordinary danger will not yeeld to ≈øuch a Po≈øture as the Kingdom thinks mo≈øt ≈øafe, whether the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may not order that Po≈øture of them≈øelves, ≈øo the <hi>Parliament</hi> puts it. But the King puts it thus. If the Parliament invades his power over the <hi>Militia</hi> cau≈øele≈øly, whether they may not as wel ≈øeize a any ≈øubjects E≈øtates.</p>
            <p>That que≈øtion then which mu≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all, is this, whether that Po≈øture which the <hi>Parliament</hi> chu≈øes, or that of the Kings, be mo≈øt ≈øafe for the Kingdom at this time, and who ≈øhall judge mo≈øt properly. Till now that the ancient pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Law, and policy were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the ≈øtate ≈øet upon a new ba≈øis, no evill was to be pre≈øumed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative body of the Kingdome, nor no Ju≈øtice expected from a King de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
